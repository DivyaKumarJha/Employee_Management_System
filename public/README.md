The main dependencies (already listed in package.json)
Make sure to also configure Tailwind CSS properly (tailwind.config.js, postcss.config.js) if you're cloning the project :)


## Notes

- This is a fully frontend-oriented project built with React and Tailwind CSS.

- It is fully functional on the frontend, with admin and employee dashboards.

- Currently, the project does not use a backend; all data is stored in localStorage.

- Admin and Employee credentials are hardcoded for learning purposes.

- Backend integration and authentication will be added in the future as I continue learning backend development.
